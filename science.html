	<th> <p> Science topic description: </th>
	<th> IIndia's GSAT satellites, along with other Earth observation satellites, play a crucial role in weather prediction. These satellites provide real-time data on atmospheric conditions, which is essential for accurate weather forecasting. The data collected helps meteorologists monitor weather patterns, predict severe weather events, and issue timely warnings to mitigate the impact of natural disasters.</p>

        <p>Satellite technology is invaluable in disaster management. During natural disasters like floods, cyclones, and earthquakes, satellites provide critical information on affected areas, helping authorities coordinate rescue and relief operations. For instance, satellite imagery can be used to assess damage, monitor flood levels, and track the movement of cyclones, enabling timely and effective response efforts.</p>


        <p>IThe Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), or NavIC, is India's own regional satellite navigation system. It provides accurate positioning and timing services to users in India and the surrounding region. NavIC is particularly useful for applications such as transportation, agriculture, and disaster management, where precise navigation is critical.</p>

 <p>India's contributions to satellite technology have not only enhanced its capabilities in these areas but also positioned the country as a leader in space technology on the global stage. The advancements made by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) continue to benefit society in numerous ways, from improving weather forecasts to ensuring safer navigation and more effective disaster response.</p>
