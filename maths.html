    <h2><p align ="center" <p><u>Contributions of Aryabhata the Indian
mathematicians</u></p></h2>
	<th> <p> Maths Topic Description: </th>
	<th> <p>Aryabhata provided an approximation of π as <em>62832/20000</em>, which equals approximately 3.1416. This value was remarkably accurate for his time and reflects his advanced understanding of geometry and arithmetic.</p>

    <p>One of the fascinating aspects of Aryabhata's work is his treatment of quadratic equations. Here is an example of how he might approach solving a quadratic equation:</p>
    <p>Consider the quadratic equation: <em>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</em></p>
    <p>Aryabhata provided a method for finding the roots of this equation. The roots can be found using the quadratic formula:</p>
    <p><em>x = (-b ± sqrt(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac)) / (2a)</em></p>
    <p>This formula, which is still widely used today, demonstrates Aryabhata's advanced understanding of algebra and his ability to develop efficient algorithms for solving mathematical problems.</p>

        <p>Aryabhata introduced methods for solving quadratic equations. In his work, he provided algorithms for finding the roots of quadratic equations, which were later refined and expanded upon by other mathematicians.</p>

 <p>Aryabhata's work on trigonometry was pioneering. He introduced the concepts of sine (jya), cosine (kojya), and versine (utkrama-jya). These concepts are fundamental to trigonometry and are still used in modern mathematics.</p>
<p>Aryabhata wrote about various arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. His methods were precise and efficient, forming the basis for many mathematical procedures used today.</p>

<p>Aryabhata worked on the summation of series, including arithmetic progressions. He provided formulas for calculating the sum of squares and cubes of natural numbers, which are still taught in mathematics today.</p>
